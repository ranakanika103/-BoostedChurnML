# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction using Boosting Algorithms

A machine learning project to **predict customer churn** using powerful **boosting algorithms**.  
This project is designed with an **industry-oriented ML workflow**, focusing on performance, scalability, and real-world business impact.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to stop using their services.  
In this project, multiple **boosting models** are trained and optimized to accurately classify churned vs non-churned customers.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Predict customer churn with high accuracy
- Compare different boosting algorithms
- Apply feature scaling and proper preprocessing
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance
- Build a reusable and clean ML pipeline

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented

### 🔹 Boosting Algorithms
- ✅ XGBoost (XGBClassifier)
- ✅ LightGBM (LGBMClassifier)
- ✅ AdaBoost (AdaBoostClassifier)

> These models are widely used in the industry for structured/tabular datasets.

---

## 🧪 Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling using **StandardScaler**
- Splitting dataset into training and testing sets

---

## ⚙️ Hyperparameter Tuning

### 🔍 Optimization Method
- **RandomizedSearchCV**

### 🔹 Why Random Search?
- Faster than Grid Search
- Efficient for large parameter spaces
- Improves generalization and reduces overfitting

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix

> Evaluation focuses on **balanced performance**, not accuracy alone.
